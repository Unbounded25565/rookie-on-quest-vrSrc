echo === Git Worktree Initialization for Story %STORY_ID% ===

REM Step 1: Check if worktree already exists
if exist "%WORKTREE_DIR%" (
    echo [WARNING] Worktree already exists at %WORKTREE_DIR%
    echo Options:
    echo   1. Use existing worktree - cd %WORKTREE_DIR%
    echo   2. Remove and recreate
    echo.
    set /p USE_EXISTING="Use existing worktree? (y/n): "

        exit /b 0
    ) else (
        echo [ABORTED] Please remove existing worktree first
        exit /b 1
    )
)

REM Step 2: Create worktree and branch
echo [INFO] Creating git worktree...
cd /d "%PROJECT_ROOT%"
git worktree add "%WORKTREE_DIR%" -b "%BRANCH_NAME%"

if errorlevel 1 (
    echo [ERROR] Failed to create worktree
    echo Possible causes:
    echo   - Branch '%BRANCH_NAME%' already exists
    echo   - Worktree path already exists
    echo.
    echo Fix:
    echo   git worktree remove %BRANCH_NAME%
    echo   git branch -D %BRANCH_NAME%
    exit /b 1
)

echo [OK] Worktree created successfully

REM Step 3: Create .story-id file in worktree
echo [INFO] Creating .story-id file...
echo %STORY_ID%> "%WORKTREE_DIR%\.story-id"
echo [OK] Story ID set to: %STORY_ID%

REM Step 4: Create .story-files manifest
echo [INFO] Creating .story-files manifest...
(
echo # Story Files Manifest
echo # This file tracks which files are modified by this story to prevent conflicts
echo storyId: "%STORY_ID%"
echo storyTitle: "Auto-generated - update from story file"
echo storyFiles:
echo   # Add file patterns here as you work (e.g., app/src/main/java/**/*.kt)
echo modifiedDuringStory: []
) > "%WORKTREE_DIR%\.story-files"
echo [OK] .story-files manifest created

REM Step 4.5: Copy essential gitignored folders from .worktreeinclude
echo [INFO] Copying files from .worktreeinclude...
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "%~dp0copy-worktree-files.ps1" -ProjectRoot "%PROJECT_ROOT%" -WorktreeDir "%WORKTREE_DIR%"

REM Step 5: Verify setup
echo.
echo === Setup Complete ===
echo.
echo Worktree Location: %WORKTREE_DIR%
echo Branch Name: %BRANCH_NAME%
echo Story ID: %STORY_ID%
echo.
echo Next Steps for ANY Agent:
echo   1. Navigate to worktree: cd /d "%WORKTREE_DIR%"
echo   2. Verify story ID: type .story-id
echo   3. Start development (agent will auto-detect story from .story-id)
echo.
echo For Developers:
echo   - Open IDE/Editor at: %WORKTREE_DIR%
echo   - Update .story-files as you modify files
echo   - When done: push branch and create PR
echo.
echo Ready for development!
