     * Why not remove:
     * 1. Room databases may contain COPYING_OBB values from v2.5.0+ migrations
     * 2. Removing would cause enum parsing failures for existing installations
     * 3. The state is safely mapped to INSTALLING in the UI layer (no user impact)
     *
     * Future consideration: Can be removed in a major version with proper migration.
