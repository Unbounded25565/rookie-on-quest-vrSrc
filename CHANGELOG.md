## [Unreleased]

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- **AGP 9.0.0 Upgrade Rejected:** Android Studio recommended upgrading to Android Gradle Plugin 9.0.0, but this caused build failures due to Room 2.6.1 incompatibility with Kotlin 2.2.x (kotlinx-metadata-jvm version mismatch). Reverted to AGP 8.13.2 + Kotlin 1.9.22. Future upgrade will require migrating Room to 2.8.x with KSP.

- **Popularity Tracking:** Games now have popularity data to help you find trending titles.
- **Favorites System:** You can now mark games as favorites! They will appear with a gold border and can be easily accessed via a new "Favorites" filter tab.
- **Special Install Support:** Added support for games with custom installation scripts (e.g., ports like Quake3Quest) via `install.txt` parsing to handle complex data placement.
