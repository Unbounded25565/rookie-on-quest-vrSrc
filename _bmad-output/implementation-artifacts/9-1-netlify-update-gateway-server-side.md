# Story 9.1: Netlify Update Gateway (Server-side)

Status: review

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a developer,
I want to implement a secure Netlify function for app updates,
so that I can serve update metadata and APK download links securely to authorized application instances.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Endpoint Creation**: Create a Netlify function `check-update.js` located at `Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js`.
2. **Routing**: Configure `Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify.toml` to redirect `/api/check-update` to the `.netlify/functions/check-update` endpoint.
3. **Security Validation**:
    - The function MUST validate a custom header `X-Rookie-Signature`.
    - Validation MUST use HMAC-SHA256 with a secret key (`ROOKIE_UPDATE_SECRET`) stored in Netlify environment variables.
    - Validation MUST use a timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks.
    - The function MUST return `401 Unauthorized` if the header is missing or `403 Forbidden` if the signature is invalid.
4. **Metadata Response**:
    - On successful validation, return a `200 OK` with a JSON body containing:
        - `version`: The latest available version string (e.g., "2.5.0").
        - `changelog`: A string containing the release notes in Markdown format.
        - `downloadUrl`: A direct or obfuscated/signed URL to the APK file.
        - `checksum`: The SHA-256 hash of the APK for client-side verification.
        - `timestamp`: The ISO 8601 timestamp of the response.
5. **APK Storage**:
    - APK files MUST be stored in a non-indexed directory (e.g., `Sunshine-AIO-web/public/updates/rookie/`).
    - The `downloadUrl` should point to this location.
    - *Note: For initial implementation/testing, a placeholder APK is explicitly intentional. Real APKs will be deployed via CI/CD.*
6. **Implementation Style**:
    - Use ESM (`export const handler = ...`) consistent with existing functions like `chat.js`.
    - Use Node.js 18 as specified in `netlify.toml`.

- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Commit story file to git before marking status as "review" to maintain proper workflow compliance [9-1-netlify-update-gateway-server-side.md]

#### Round 2 (2026-02-14) - ADVERSARIAL REVIEW FINDINGS
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Fix DOUBLE PATH bug in check-update.js line 71 - remove hardcoded 'Sunshine-AIO-web' from path.join() as process.cwd() already includes it, causing Test 3 to fail with ENOENT [Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js:71]
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Commit story file to git - currently untracked (??) violates workflow compliance requirement [9-1-netlify-update-gateway-server-side.md]
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Replace placeholder APK with actual built APK file (~15-50 MB) OR update AC #5 and story notes to clarify placeholder is intentional for testing [Sunshine-AIO-web/public/updates/rookie/RookieOnQuest_2.5.0.apk]

- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Test function in actual Netlify environment - verify process.cwd() resolution works in serverless context, not just local tests [Deployment testing]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Verify AC compliance after fixes - currently only 2/6 ACs working, need to validate all 6 before marking done [All Acceptance Criteria]

#### Round 3 (2026-02-14) - ADVERSARIAL REVIEW ROUND 3 (13 Issues Found)
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Fix overly permissive CORS - replace `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with explicit allowlist for authorized domains (rookie.vrpirates.org) to prevent malicious apps from exploiting update endpoint [Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js:8]
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Replace placeholder APK (52 bytes) with actual built APK file (~15-50 MB) OR update AC #5 to explicitly state "placeholder for testing only" [Sunshine-AIO-web/public/updates/rookie/RookieOnQuest_2.5.0.apk]
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Implement timestamp validation - verify X-Rookie-Date is within ±5 minutes of server time to prevent replay attacks, currently timestamp used for HMAC but never validated [Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js:21-22, 44-46]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add Cache-Control header to JSON response - set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` (5 minutes) to prevent indefinite caching of update metadata by CDNs/clients [Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js:84-91]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Optimize file reading - consider implementing in-memory cache for version.json to reduce disk I/O on every request, or verify Netlify's caching behavior [Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js:72]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Remove duplicate path in _headers - consolidate `/updates/*` and `/updates/rookie/*` rules as second is already covered by first [Sunshine-AIO-web/public/_headers:1-11]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Expand test coverage - add tests for timestamp validation (future dates, replay attacks), invalid HTTP methods (POST/DELETE), and edge cases [Sunshine-AIO-web/tests/check-update.test.js]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Fix header typo - change `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to correct `nosniff` (double 's') in _headers file [Sunshine-AIO-web/public/_headers:4, 9]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Add server-side checksum verification - validate APK exists and SHA256 matches declared checksum before returning downloadUrl to client [Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js:69-91]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Align directory structure with AC #5 specification - currently AC specifies `Sunshine-AIO-web/public/updates/rookie/` but _headers uses `/updates/*` paths [Sunshine-AIO-web/public/_headers:1-11]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Enhance error logging - replace `console.error()` with structured logging (request ID, timestamps) for production Netlify Functions monitoring [Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js:34, 94]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Add JSDoc comments to metadata response block - document URL resolution logic and headers generation for maintainability [Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/check-update.js:69-99]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Add negative test cases - add tests for malformed headers, invalid date formats, corrupted JSON, and other edge cases beyond current positive/negative scenarios [Sunshine-AIO-web/tests/check-update.test.js]

## Dev Notes

- **Reference Implementation**: See `Sunshine-AIO-web/netlify/functions/chat.js` for the established ESM pattern and CORS handling.
- **HMAC Secret**: The developer will need to set `ROOKIE_UPDATE_SECRET` in the Netlify dashboard. For local development, it can be added to a `.env` file in `Sunshine-AIO-web`.
- **CORS**: While the primary client is a native Android app, adding standard CORS headers (like in `chat.js`) is recommended for testing and future-proofing.

### Project Structure Notes
