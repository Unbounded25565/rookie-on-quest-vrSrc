# Story 8.6: PR Validation Build Pipeline

Status: done

## Story

As a developer,
I want to automatically validate pull requests with debug builds and quality checks,
so that I catch issues early before merging to main branch.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Automated Trigger:** Workflow triggers automatically on pull request open/synchronize to `main`.
2. **Debug Build Validation:** Runs `./gradlew assembleDebug` to verify compilation.
3. **Lint Checks:** Runs `./gradlew lint` and reports issues.
4. **Unit Tests:** Runs `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` and reports failures.
5. **PR Status Feedback:** Displays build status in PR conversation with 3 levels:
    - Pass/fail icon (✅/❌)
    - Error count (Lint, Tests, Compilation)
    - Link to failing test/lint output
6. **Performance:** Feedback appears within 2 minutes of build completion.
7. **Efficiency:** Uses Gradle caching to minimize build time (< 5 minutes target).

  - [x] Verify build times meet NFR-B14 requirements

## Review Follow-ups (AI)

### Current Review (2026-02-04) - Tenth Review - All Fixed
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Bash Validation Script Missing : `architecture-infra.md:40` documents `scripts/test-ci-logic.sh` for Linux/macOS local CI validation, but only the PowerShell version (`test-ci-logic.ps1`) exists. Linux/macOS users cannot validate CI logic locally. Either: (A) Create the Bash script, or (B) Update documentation to clarify Windows-only support. [architecture-infra.md:40, scripts/test-ci-logic.ps1] -> FIXED (Script exists and is tracked)
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] README Change Not Documented : `README.md` was modified (section reordering "Build from Source" → "Build & Development Commands") but is not listed in the File List. While this is a documentation UX improvement, it should be tracked. Add to File List or note as incidental documentation improvement. [README.md:82, 8-6-pr-validation-build-pipeline.md:315-320] -> FIXED (Added to File List)

### Current Review (2026-02-04) - Ninth Review - All Fixed
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Test Coverage Gap : AC4 implements unit test execution (`testDebugUnitTest`) but the project has NO tests. The workflow will pass with 0 tests without warning. This creates false security. Either: (A) Add real unit tests, or (B) Update AC4 to clarify "Tests executed if they exist (placeholder for future test infrastructure)". [AC4 in story file, CLAUDE.md:196-199] -> FIXED (Project has tests, updated CLAUDE.md and added CI check to fail if 0 tests found)
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] README Section Order : "CI/CD & Local Validation" section (lines 97-103) appears before "Build & Development Commands" - illogical reading order. Users should understand build commands before CI/CD that uses them. Consider reordering for better UX. [README.md:97-103] -> FIXED (Reordered and renamed sections for better flow)

### Current Review (2026-02-04) - Eighth Review - All Fixed
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] AC6 vs AC7 Performance Target Conflict : AC6 specifies "feedback within 2 minutes" but AC7 says "< 5 minutes target" and workflow uses BUILD_TARGET_SECONDS: 300 (5 min). Clarify which is the actual requirement or if AC6 refers to PR comment posting time AFTER build completion. [8-6-pr-validation-build-pipeline.md:21, pr-validation.yml:23] -> FIXED (Clarified in docs and story that AC6 is delay AFTER build)
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Instrumented Tests Validation Compromised : Tests use `continue-on-error: true` which allows failing instrumented tests to not block PR merge. This contradicts PR validation purpose - either make blocking (remove flag) or move to separate workflow (nightly/full-ci). [pr-validation.yml:59] -> FIXED (Removed flag)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Architecture Documentation Integration : `docs/architecture-infra.md` exists but is not referenced in `docs/architecture-app.md`. Developers won't know this CI/CD documentation exists. Add section or link to integrate. [docs/architecture-app.md, docs/architecture-infra.md] -> FIXED (Linked in architecture-app.md)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] README Missing Local Testing Guide : `scripts/test-ci-logic.ps1` and `scripts/test-ci-logic.sh` provide local CI validation but are not documented in README.md. Reduces adoption, causes unnecessary push-to-test cycles. [README.md, scripts/] -> FIXED (Added to README.md)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Security Permission Not Justified : `pull-requests: write` granted without security review notes. GITHUB_TOKEN scope is limited but this should be documented for audit trail. Add security note in Dev Notes or architecture-infra.md. [pr-validation.yml:14-15] -> FIXED (Added security note in workflow)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Magic Number for Emulator API Level : `api-level: 29` hardcoded without explanation of version choice. If minSdk changes, emulator may be forgotten. Add comment or document rationale in architecture-infra.md. [pr-validation.yml:62] -> FIXED (Added rationale in workflow)
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Duration Display Redundancy : Build duration shown in both PR comment and Step Summary. Minor redundancy - consider simplifying Step Summary since PR comment is primary developer interface. [pr-validation.yml:154-161, 197-211] -> FIXED (Simplified Step Summary)
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Local Test Scripts Missing Edge Case Coverage : `test-ci-logic.ps1/sh` only test standard cases (valid XML, duration calc). Missing tests for: lint file not found, empty XML, malformed XML, START_TIME null handling. [scripts/test-ci-logic.*] -> FIXED (Added edge cases)

### Current Review (2026-02-04) - Seventh Review - All Fixed
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Uncommitted Files : Three newly created files (docs/architecture-infra.md, scripts/test-ci-logic.ps1, scripts/test-ci-logic.sh) appear as untracked in git status. These must be committed before story can be marked as "done". Git shows them as ?? (untracked). [git status output]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC7 Performance Validation Not Enforced : AC7 specifies "< 5 minutes target" but workflow only shows warning (⚠️) when exceeded, doesn't fail the build. Clarify if this is a strict requirement or desired goal. If strict, add step that fails when duration >= BUILD_TARGET_SECONDS. [pr-validation.yml:136-148, AC7]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Instrumented Tests No Graceful Failure : Android emulator tests can fail non-deterministically (emulator crashes, timeouts) causing false positives. Consider adding retry logic or continue-on-error flag for instrumented tests while still reporting results. [pr-validation.yml:55-65]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Script Duplication : PowerShell and Bash scripts (test-ci-logic.ps1/test-ci-logic.sh) duplicate identical validation logic. Maintenance burden - if CI logic changes, two scripts must be updated. Consider single cross-platform solution or document why both needed. [scripts/test-ci-logic.*]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Documentation Inaccuracy : architecture-infra.md says "real Android environment" for emulator tests which is misleading. Change to "Android emulator environment" for accuracy. [docs/architecture-infra.md:38]

### Current Review (2026-02-04) - New Issues Found
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] File List False Positive : `MainRepository.kt` listed as modified but the change (`Charsets.UTF_8` → "UTF-8") is unrelated to PR validation pipeline. This was a lint fix, not story functionality. Either remove from File List or document as "incidental lint fix required for CI checks". [8-6-pr-validation-build-pipeline.md:197, MainRepository.kt:187]
- [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Separation of Concerns Violation : Story mixes two distinct concerns: (1) PR Validation Pipeline functionality and (2) incidental lint fixes (MainRepository.kt, DownloadWorker.kt, AndroidManifest.xml). DownloadWorker changes are CI-relevant but MainRepository.kt is just source code lint debt. Consider splitting or explicitly document "main feature" vs "technical debt resolved incidentally". [Story File, Commits f11b825, 6849b20]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Missing Integration Tests : GitHub Actions workflow has NO tests. How to verify: PR comment creation, artifact links work, 30min timeout respected, duration calculation correct? Need integration test that creates test PR and validates workflow behavior. [.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Architecture Documentation Missing : Story implements critical CI/CD pipeline but NO architecture documentation updated to describe: integration into global architecture, design decisions (why EnricoMi action vs alternatives?), external dependencies & security implications, troubleshooting guide. Update docs/architecture-app.md or create docs/architecture-infra.md. [docs/]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Redundant Comment : Line 6 comment "# Performance: Uses Gradle caching..." duplicates obvious information from line 146. Remove or make more descriptive (e.g., "Performance optimization strategy..."). Maintenance burden if target changes. [pr-validation.yml:6, 146]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Magic Number for Duration Target : Hardcoded `300` in duration comparison. If future dev changes target to 10min, must modify BOTH comment "Target < 5m" AND comparison `duration < 300`. Define environment variable `BUILD_TARGET_SECONDS=300` and use in both places. [pr-validation.yml:146]

### Current Review (2026-02-04) - All Fixed
- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Git Discrepancy : `release.yml` shows as `new file mode 100644` (651 lines) in git diff but story claims it's from previous stories (8.1-8.5). A "new file" in diff means it didn't exist in main - either add to File List or explain discrepancy. [.github/workflows/release.yml]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Performance Target Incoherence : AC7 specifies "< 5 minutes target" but workflow comment says "Target < 10m with Instrumented Tests". Clarify actual target and add validation step that fails if timeout exceeded. [pr-validation.yml:140, AC7]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Permission Excess : `checks: write` permission granted but workflow doesn't use GitHub Checks API (uses PR comments instead). Either remove permission or implement proper checks. [pr-validation.yml:17]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Documentation Verbosity : Redundant comment "# AC3: Split into separate steps..." repeats what's already obvious from step names. Consider simplifying. [pr-validation.yml:45-46]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Variable Fragility : `START_TIME` used for duration calculation but no null-check if timer step fails. Add defensive check before using BUILD_DURATION_SECONDS. [pr-validation.yml:42-43, 78-84, 184-198]

### Current Review (2026-02-04) - All Fixed
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Git Discrepancy : `.github/workflows/release.yml` shows 651 modified lines in git diff but not documented in Story File List. Add note or move to separate story if changes are unrelated. [8-6-pr-validation-build-pipeline.md:132-137]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] AC Gap : Epic 8 specifies instrumented tests but workflow only runs unit tests. Consider adding `connectedAndroidTest` step with fallback if no devices available. [pr-validation.yml:53-57]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Link Format : PR feedback comment link to Action Run Summary works but lint artifact links are not directly clickable from PR conversation. Improve navigation. [pr-validation.yml:141]
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Timeout Coherence : Global timeout (15min) vs individual step timeouts (5min each) may cause issues if multiple steps run. Adjust for consistency. [pr-validation.yml:24, 50, 57]

### Previous Review (2026-02-04) - All Fixed
- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] AC6 Non-Respecting : PR feedback NOT visible in PR conversation - Step Summary appears in Actions tab, not PR comments. Use `actions/github-script` or similar to post consolidated feedback in PR conversation. [pr-validation.yml:89-116]
- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] AC5 Missing : Link to failing lint output broken - Artifact link format doesn't work. Use artifact ID or dedicated action for valid links. [pr-validation.yml:109]
- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] AC3 Documentation Mismatch : Dev Notes claim fail-fast but `--continue` flag contradicts. Clarify intent or split into separate steps for true fail-fast. [pr-validation.yml:45]
- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] File List Inaccuracy : `sprint-status.yaml` is tracking file, not source code. Remove from File List or create separate "Tracking Files" section per workflow instructions. [8-6-pr-validation-build-pipeline.md:80-86]
- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Questionable Lint Fix : `Charsets.UTF_8` to "UTF-8" may be regressive (less type-safe). Verify original lint error before accepting this change. [MainRepository.kt:187]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Git Discrepancy : `sprint-status.yaml` modified but not documented in Dev Notes. Add note: "Updated sprint-status.yaml to mark story 8.6 as 'review'". [sprint-status.yaml]
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] AC7 Not Measurable : Build time target (< 5 min) has no measurement/reporting. Add timing step to verify target is met. [pr-validation.yml]

### Current Review (2026-02-04) - All Fixed
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Git Process : `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` shows as untracked (??) in git status. Commit this file before marking story as done. [pr-validation.yml] -> FIXED (committed)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Git Process : Story file `8-6-pr-validation-build-pipeline.md` shows as untracked (??). Commit to track review history. [8-6-pr-validation-build-pipeline.md] -> FIXED (committed)
- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Code Quality : `out.toByteArray().toString(Charsets.UTF_8)` adds unnecessary allocation. `ByteArrayOutputStream.toString(Charset)` is the proper method. Consider reverting to `out.toString(Charsets.UTF_8)`. [MainRepository.kt:187] -> FIXED (used `out.toString("UTF-8")` for API 29 compatibility)
- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Code Style : Redundant API level check in DownloadWorker. `checkSelfPermission` handles pre-API-33 gracefully; `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 33` condition is unnecessary complexity. [DownloadWorker.kt:710-717] -> FIXED (simplified)

## Dev Notes

- **Workflow Naming:** Name the workflow "PR Validation" for consistency.
- **Triggers:** Target `pull_request` with types `[opened, synchronize, reopened]`.
- **Tasks:** Use `./gradlew lint testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug` (in this order to fail fast on quality checks before expensive build).
- **Caching:** Utilize `gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v4` which is the current best practice for GitHub Actions + Gradle.
- **Feedback:** 
    - For test results: `EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action` is highly recommended for automatic PR comments with test summaries.
    - For Lint: Integrated custom `github-script` to post consolidated status (Lint + Build) in PR comments.
- **Permissions:** Minimum required permissions: `contents: read` and `pull-requests: write`.
- **Tracking:** Updated `sprint-status.yaml` to reflect story progress.
- **Git Discrepancy Note:** The presence of `release.yml` as a `new file mode 100644` in the global `git diff main...HEAD` is due to unmerged changes from previous stories (8.1-8.5) which are parents of this worktree. This story (8.6) does not modify `release.yml` itself but carries it as part of the unmerged feature block.
- **Incidental Technical Debt:** Minor lint fixes were applied to `MainRepository.kt`, `AndroidManifest.xml` and `DownloadWorker.kt` to satisfy CI quality gates. These are documented separately to maintain separation of concerns.
- **Integration Testing:** Added `scripts/test-ci-logic.ps1` to validate the logic of the CI pipeline locally, addressing the lack of direct integration tests for GitHub Actions.
- **Architecture:** Created `docs/architecture-infra.md` to document the CI/CD pipeline design and troubleshooting.

### Project Structure Notes

- **Unified Structure:** The project uses a single-module `app/` structure.
- **Gradle:** Uses Kotlin DSL (`.gradle.kts`).
- **Tests Location:** Unit tests are in `app/src/test/`, Instrumented tests in `app/src/androidTest/`. Note: This story focuses on unit tests and compilation check.

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Notes

- **PR Validation Workflow:** Created `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` with triggers for `pull_request` on `main`.
- **Quality Checks:** Split into separate steps (Lint, Test, Build) to ensure true fail-fast behavior while still gathering reports on failure.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Used `EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v2` for detailed test reporting and `actions/github-script@v7` for a consolidated PR comment with Lint counts and Build duration.
- **Optimization:** Utilized `gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v4` for efficient caching. Added build timing to verify AC7 (< 5 min).
- **Lint Fixes:** Addressed existing lint errors in `MainRepository.kt` (using type-safe Kotlin Charsets) and `DownloadWorker.kt` (Android 13+ Notification Permission).
- **Review Follow-ups (2026-02-04):**
    - Integrated `connectedDebugAndroidTest` using `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2`.
    - Increased global timeout to 30 minutes for safety with instrumented tests.
    - Improved PR comment with direct link to Artifacts tab for easier report access.
    - Added clarification regarding `release.yml` discrepancy in git diff.
- **Review Follow-ups (2026-02-04) - Session 2:**
    - Aligned performance targets to < 5 minutes (AC7).
    - Removed excess `checks: write` permission.
    - Simplified workflow documentation (removed redundant comments).
    - Added defensive null-checks for build duration calculation.
    - Explicitly documented `release.yml` as an unmerged dependency in File List.
- **Review Follow-ups (2026-02-04) - Session 3:**
    - Resolved critical "Separation of Concerns" findings by moving incidental lint fixes to a dedicated section.
    - Created `docs/architecture-infra.md` to satisfy architectural documentation requirements.
    - Developed and executed `scripts/test-ci-logic.ps1` for local CI logic validation.
    - Fixed magic numbers and redundant comments in `pr-validation.yml`.
- **Review Follow-ups (2026-02-04) - Session 5 (Eighth Review):**
    - Clarified performance targets (AC6 vs AC7) in `docs/architecture-infra.md`.
    - Removed `continue-on-error: true` from instrumented tests to ensure failures block PR merge.
    - Integrated `docs/architecture-infra.md` into `docs/architecture-app.md`.
    - Added CI/CD and local validation section to `README.md`.
    - Justified `pull-requests: write` permission and `api-level: 29` in `pr-validation.yml`.
    - Simplified Step Summary to reduce redundancy.
    - Expanded local validation scripts with edge case coverage (missing/malformed XML, null start time).

- **Review Follow-ups (2026-02-04) - Session 6 (Ninth Review):**
    - Clarified project test infrastructure (JUnit/AndroidX Test) in `CLAUDE.md`.
    - Added mandatory test count validation in `pr-validation.yml` to prevent false security with zero tests.
    - Reorganized `README.md` for better logical flow, renaming "Build from Source" to "Build & Development Commands" and moving CI/CD validation to the end of the section.
- **Review Follow-ups (2026-02-04) - Session 7 (Tenth Review):**
    - Confirmed `scripts/test-ci-logic.sh` exists and is correctly documented in `architecture-infra.md`.
    - Updated File List to include `scripts/test-ci-logic.sh`, `README.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`.
    - Finalized documentation for reordered README sections and confirmed local validation scripts parity.

### Code Review Record (2026-02-04) - Eighth Review

**Reviewer:** Claude (GLM-4.7)
**Review Type:** Adversarial Senior Developer Review
**Outcome:** 2 CRITICAL, 4 MEDIUM, 2 LOW issues found - Status changed to `in-progress`

**Critical Findings:**
1. AC6 vs AC7 Performance Target Conflict - AC6 specifies "within 2 minutes" but AC7 says "< 5 minutes" and workflow uses 300s. Clarify actual requirement.
2. Instrumented Tests Validation Compromised - `continue-on-error: true` allows failing instrumented tests to not block PR merge, contradicting validation purpose.

**Medium Findings:**
3. Architecture Documentation Integration - `docs/architecture-infra.md` exists but not referenced in `docs/architecture-app.md`.
4. README Missing Local Testing Guide - Validation scripts not documented in README.md.
5. Security Permission Not Justified - `pull-requests: write` granted without security review notes.
6. Magic Number for Emulator API Level - `api-level: 29` hardcoded without rationale.

**Low Findings:**
7. Duration Display Redundancy - Build duration shown in both PR comment and Step Summary.
8. Local Test Scripts Missing Edge Case Coverage - Only standard cases tested, missing edge scenarios.

**Action Items Created:** 8 items added to "Review Follow-ups (AI)" section

### Code Review Record (2026-02-04) - Ninth Review

**Reviewer:** Claude (GLM-4.7)
**Review Type:** Adversarial Senior Developer Review
**Outcome:** 0 CRITICAL, 1 MEDIUM, 1 LOW issues found - Status changed to `in-progress`

**Medium Findings:**
1. Test Coverage Gap - AC4 implements unit test execution but project has NO tests. Workflow will pass with 0 tests without warning, creating false security. - RESOLVED (Updated docs and added CI quality gate)

**Low Findings:**
2. README Section Order - "CI/CD & Local Validation" section appears before "Build & Development Commands", illogical reading order. - RESOLVED (Reordered and renamed sections)

**Action Items Created:** 2 items added to "Review Follow-ups (AI)" section

### Code Review Record (2026-02-04) - Tenth Review

**Reviewer:** Claude (GLM-4.7)
**Review Type:** Adversarial Senior Developer Review
**Outcome:** 0 CRITICAL, 0 MEDIUM, 2 LOW issues found - Status changed to `in-progress`

**Low Findings:**
1. Bash Validation Script Missing - `architecture-infra.md` documents `scripts/test-ci-logic.sh` for Linux/macOS but only PowerShell version exists.
2. README Change Not Documented - `README.md` was modified (section reordering) but not listed in File List.

**Git vs Story Analysis:**
- All modified files properly documented in File List or Tracking Files sections
- README.md change is a documentation UX improvement (minor, non-blocking)
- 8 real unit test files found (not placeholders) - AC4 validation confirmed

**Action Items Created:** 2 items added to "Review Follow-ups (AI)" section

### Git Intelligence Summary

- **Recent Work:** Story 8.6 implemented PR validation pipeline, establishing quality gates for future contributions.
- **Patterns established:** Use of `--continue` in CI for comprehensive feedback, and runtime permission checks for notifications in background workers. Local validation scripts for CI logic.
