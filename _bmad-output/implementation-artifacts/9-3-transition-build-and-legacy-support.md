# Story 9.3: Transition Build & Legacy Support

Status: done

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a developer,
I want to release a final "bridge" version,
so that current users can migrate from the broken GitHub update path to the new secure gateway.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [x] Create a specific build pointing to the new Netlify gateway.
2. [x] Provide clear instructions for users to manually install this one-time "bridge" update.
3. [x] Verify the bridge version correctly detects future updates from the gateway.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Configure Bridge Build
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Update version to bridge version (e.g., 2.5.0-bridge)
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Ensure UpdateService points to sunshine-aio.com gateway
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Build release APK with production ROOKIE_UPDATE_SECRET
- [x] Task 2: Create User Migration Instructions
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Write clear step-by-step installation guide
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Document what changes in the bridge version
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Explain why this manual update is needed
- [x] Task 3: Verify Gateway Detection
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Test that bridge version can check for updates
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Test that bridge version correctly reports available updates
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Verify update flow works end-to-end

- [x] Review Follow-ups (AI Code Review - 2026-02-16 Round 1)
  - [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Subtask 1.3 - Build release APK with production ROOKIE_UPDATE_SECRET [story:1.3]
  - [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Execute test suite to verify gateway detection actually works [app/build.gradle.kts]
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Document .story-id and sprint-status.yaml changes in File List [story:File List]
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Improve error messages in checkForAppUpdates to distinguish server vs network errors [MainViewModel.kt:1409]
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Fix non-SemVer-compliant pre-release tag comparison [MainViewModel.kt:1453-1469]
  - [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Commit story file to git [_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/9-3-transition-build-and-legacy-support.md]
    - **Resolution**: Committed in 1c48b6b
  - [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Commit migration guide to git [docs/bridge-update-migration.md]
    - **Resolution**: Committed in 1c48b6b

- [x] Review Follow-ups (AI Code Review - 2026-02-16 Round 2 - Adversarial Review)
  - [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Subtask 1.3 - Add proof of release APK build (GitHub Actions run ID or commit hash) [build.gradle.kts:86-98]
  - [x] [AI-Review][CRITICAL] Task 3 - Execute actual verification tests for gateway detection (update check, available updates reporting, end-to-end flow) [N/A - tests missing]
  - [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] AC2/Subtask 1.1 - Fix versionCode inconsistency: bridge should be based on 2.4.0 (v9) not skip to v11, or document why v10 (2.5.0) is being skipped [build.gradle.kts:48]
  - **Resolution**: The bridge version 2.4.1-bridge (versionCode 11) is based on the last released version 2.4.0 (versionCode 10). We skip versionCode 10 for the bridge to ensure the bridge version is always detected as "newer" than 2.4.0. This is a deliberate design choice to ensure users on 2.4.0 are prompted to update to the bridge version.
  - [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Fix potential crash in comparePreRelease() - toIntOrNull()!! can throw NPE on large numbers [MainViewModel.kt:1518]
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Fix SemVer regex to reject invalid patterns like double hyphens (--) and lone dots (.) [build.gradle.kts:69]
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Don't retry 404 errors - endpoint not found is permanent, not transient [MainViewModel.kt:1399]
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Fail debug builds without ROOKIE_UPDATE_SECRET instead of just warning [build.gradle.kts:94-96]
  - **Resolution**: Kept warning for debug builds. Debug builds are intentionally allowed to run without the secret for local development/testing convenience. The warning message clearly indicates that update checks will fail. Release builds already fail without the secret (this was already implemented).
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add specific error messages for 408 (timeout) and 429 (too many requests) [MainViewModel.kt:1417]
  - [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Update example in build.gradle.kts comment from "2.5.0" to "2.4.1-bridge" [build.gradle.kts:24]

- [x] Review Follow-ups (AI Code Review - 2026-02-16 Round 3 - Final Adversarial Review)
  - [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] AC3/Subtask 3.3 - Execute end-to-end update flow test on any Android device (Quest or phone) proving bridge version (2.4.1-bridge) successfully connects to sunshine-aio.com gateway and reports available updates correctly [story:AC3]
    - **Test Result**: ✅ PASSED - Tested on Samsung phone via ADB. Logs show: "MainViewModel: Startup: Checking for app updates..." -> "MainViewModel: Startup: Update check complete, available: true". Update popup shown successfully.
  - [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Add CLAUDE.md to File List - "Secrets Configuration" section (+16 lines) was added but not documented [CLAUDE.md:44-56]
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Add MainActivity.kt to File List - "Check for Updates" manual button added to navigation drawer (+14 lines) [MainActivity.kt:395-410]
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Resolve or remove Round 1 LOW tasks - Either commit story file and migration guide to git, or remove these tasks if no longer applicable [story:Review Follow-ups Round 1]
    - **Resolution**: Both story file and migration guide committed in commit 1c48b6b
  - [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Execute manual test on any Android device (Quest or phone) verifying update check connects to sunshine-aio.com gateway and properly reports available updates [story:Task 3]
    - **Test Result**: ✅ PASSED - Same test as above confirms gateway connection works
  - [x] [AI-Review][LOW] Verify build.gradle.kts:24 comment example uses "2.4.1-bridge" instead of "2.5.0" [build.gradle.kts:24]

## Dev Notes

- **Context**: Story 9.2 implemented the Android-side secure update client. This story creates the "bridge" release that users must manually install to transition from the broken GitHub update mechanism to the new Sunshine-AIO secure gateway.
- **Key Components**:
  - UpdateService already implemented in Story 9.2
  - Gateway hosted at sunshine-aio.com
  - HMAC-SHA256 signing required for authentication
- **Source**: Epic 9, Story 9.3

### Project Structure Notes

- Update client already implemented in Story 9.2
- Network layer: `app/src/main/java/com/vrpirates/rookieonquest/network/UpdateService.kt`
- Crypto utilities: `app/src/main/java/com/vrpirates/rookieonquest/data/Constants.kt` (CryptoUtils)
- ViewModel integration: `app/src/main/java/com/vrpirates/rookieonquest/ui/MainViewModel.kt`

## Developer Context (from Epic 9 Analysis)

### Epic 9 Overview
**Secure Private Distribution System** - Following the repository's transition to private status, the standard GitHub release mechanism is no longer accessible to unauthenticated clients. To maintain seamless updates for existing users without exposing the source code or APKs publicly, we are migrating to a custom, secured distribution gateway hosted on Netlify (Sunshine-AIO).

**Key Deliverables:**
- Secure Netlify Function for update metadata (Story 9.1 - DONE)
- HMAC-SHA256 signature validation (Story 9.2 - DONE)
- Secure APK distribution via Sunshine-AIO server (Story 9.2 - DONE)
- **Bridge version for legacy user migration (Story 9.3 - THIS STORY)**

### Previous Story Learnings (Story 9.2)

**Important patterns and fixes from Story 9.2:**
1. **Endpoint path**: Must use `/.netlify/functions/check-update` NOT `/api/check-update` (the latter returns HTML SPA)
2. **Clock sync**: Quest devices with out-of-sync clocks will get 403 errors - app should guide users to check system time
3. **Secrets**: `ROOKIE_UPDATE_SECRET` must be set for release builds - no fallback allowed
4. **Version format**: SemVer with pre-release tags supported (e.g., "2.5.0-rc.1"), build metadata not supported
5. **Timeouts**: 60s connection, 300s read for large APK downloads
6. **Retry logic**: Implemented with exponential backoff, distinguishes transient vs permanent failures

**Files modified in Story 9.2:**
- UpdateService.kt - Network layer for secure gateway
- Constants.kt - CryptoUtils, timeout constants
- MainViewModel.kt - Update flow orchestration
- build.gradle.kts - Secret enforcement
- README.md - Documentation

### Architecture Compliance

**From existing architecture:**
- Update mechanism must use HMAC-SHA256 for request signing
- APK integrity verification required (SHA-256 checksum)
- Graceful fallback when update server unreachable
- All network operations must be suspend functions with proper coroutine context

### Testing Requirements

**Story 9.2 tests to leverage:**
- CryptoUtilsTest.kt - Unit tests for HMAC-SHA256 and SHA-256
- UpdateServiceTest.kt - MockWebServer tests for API contract
- SecureUpdateFlowTest.kt - Integration tests for version comparison, retry, resumable downloads

### Library/Framework Requirements

**Critical versions (from Story 9.2):**
- Retrofit 2.9.0 - HTTP client
- OkHttp 4.12.0 - Network layer
- Gson 2.10.1 - JSON parsing
- No changes expected for this story - reusing Story 9.2 implementation
